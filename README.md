# javaScript Calculator

In this project I created a calculator that was able to perform the basic aritmethic operations  (addition, subtraction, division and multiplication).
This project is from the freeCodeCamp course and it's based on the React library.


## How to clone the app locally...

Clone the git repository in the folder of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/m-onofri/js-calculator.git
```

Install the packages:
```
cd js-calculator
npm install
```

Run the server:
```
npm start
```

In your browser, go to http://localhost:3000/, and play the game.


## ...or watch it live!

## Main features

* The calculator is able to perform basic aritmethic operations (addition, subtraction, division and multiplication).
* The display show the complete expression and the current value.
* When you press the "=" button, you get the result of the expression displayed on the screen.

## Cross-browser consistency 

The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.
